# MAGD150-Assignments

This is where I will be submitting my assignments.

Assignment 1 (https://github.com/JamesMcSpankenhiemer/MAGD150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s18magd150lab01_ludwig.pde)

This was my first coding project ever.


Assignment 2 (https://github.com/JamesMcSpankenhiemer/MAGD150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/s18magd150lab02_ludwig)

2nd project, not too shabby I think



Assignment 3 (https://github.com/JamesMcSpankenhiemer/MAGD150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/s18magd150lab04_ludwig)

Slowly but surely getting the hang

Assignment 4 (https://github.com/JamesMcSpankenhiemer/MAGD150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/s18magd150lab05_ludwig)

Assignment 5 (https://github.com/JamesMcSpankenhiemer/MAGD150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/s18_magd150_lab07_Ludwig)

And this is the most formal I think I've gotten with coding
